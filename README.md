# WebVTTCaptionGen
This is a repository for the WebVTT Caption Generator project. 

This webvtt caption generator generates timestamp captions for videos roughly 1 hour and 39 minutes in length. This was originally a simple script for a class project that required a timestamp vtt file, however I figured it might be useful to someone that wants to write their own text track after each timestamp. 

If you're interested in learning more about .vtt files, you can visit the awesome article Mozilla wrote on them: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API
